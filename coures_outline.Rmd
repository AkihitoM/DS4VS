## Course Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Science Methods for Vision Science Applications will provide students with an overview of current data science tools and methodology using datasets from various fields of vision science for context.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Science is a fast growing inter-disciplinary collection of algorithms, tools and technology used to gain insights from the increasingly large and complex data generated in this digital age. Vision science and visual neuroscience have also seen a rapid increase in the volume of data generated. (e.g. neural recording arrays, imaging data, etc.) This creates a new challenge for today's graduate student: learning the field is complicated by increasingly complex data. The aim of this course is to introduce students to some of the tools and techniques from data science to meet the growing data demands of today's vision science.

## Course Requirements
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This course will be designed for students with all levels of programming skills. However, the course will be python intensive. Students with no previous python or, more generally, programming experience will be asked to complete online python tutorials before the class starts.

## Course Objectives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will build a hypothesis driven analysis of a dataset using data science tools in a python environment. Upon completion, students will gain confidence using code driven approaches in solving research questions. It is hoped that experience computing with python and using git for version control will become powerful tools to be used to enhance future research endeavors. 

## Course Evaluation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course will be divided into learning modules. Each module will be accompanied by a project template that will walk through the relevant code, concepts and methods covered in the module. Students will be given complete and commented code to be used to interpret incomplete code and/or generate new code to yield insights from various vision science datasets.
Students will use a dataset of their choosing to build a hypothesis driven data science project. This final project will incorporate modules covered in the course, results will be summarized in a report and shared in a brief oral presentation.
