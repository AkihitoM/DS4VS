repository for course materials: Data Science Methods for Vision Science Applications

## About

Data Science Methods for Vision Science Applications will provide students with an overview of current data science tools and methodology using datasets from various fields of vision science for context. 
Data Science is a fast growing inter-disciplinary collection of algorithms, tools and technology used to gain insights from the increasingly large and complex data generated in this digital age. Vision science and visual neuroscience have also seen a rapid increase in the volume of data generated. (e.g. neural recording arrays, imaging data, etc.) This creates a new challenge for today's graduate student: learning the field is complicated by increasingly complex data. The aim of this course is to introduce students to some of the tools and techniques from data science to meet the growing data demands of today's vision science.

## Course Outline

| **Module**                                | **Objectives**                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         Data Access & Manipulation        | loading a variety of data into the python environment,  `numpy` arrays & `pandas` dataframes, and an into to  version control with git            |
| Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization | data inspection, data cleaning, summary statistics and basic visualizations with `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`                                         |
|    Probability Basics & Simulating Data   | random numbers in python, probability review & simulating data                                                                                    |
|      Linear & GLM Regression Methods      | `sklearn` linear regression, multiple regression and logistic regression models, evaluation and validation                                        |
|        Machine Learning: Supervised       | basic supervised learning approaches for numeric data: regression & decision trees and categorical data: classification/categorization (e.g. kNN) |
|       Machine Learning: Unsupervised      | basic unsupervised learning approaches for numeric data: dimensionality reduction (e.g PCA) and categorical data: clustering (e.g. K-mean)        |
|               Data Naratives              | students will organize a project, prepare a report and give a brief talk to present thier findings                                                |
